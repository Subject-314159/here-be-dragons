# HERE BE DRAGONS

Once upon a time the realm of Nauvis was ruled by mighty dragons with unmatched grace and power. These majestic beings, with their ancient wisdom and fierce strength, were the undisputed rulers of Nauvis. As ages passed and the world began to change, only a few dragons could adapt to the new era, learning to coexist peacefully alongside biters and spitters.

This mod introduces a "Dragon" unit that breathes fire. It is highly resistant to different types of damage and moderately stronger than Behemoths. Uranium bullets are your best bet, however your gun turret's range might fall just a bit too short to remain completely safe. The dragon's fire breath is not too strong, but don't underestimate the burning effect of the smoldering ground.

# Why this mod

Well, dragons, need I say more? I found this very cool [dragon 3D model](https://opengameart.org/content/cethiels-dragon-3d) and felt obliged to mod it into Factorio.
